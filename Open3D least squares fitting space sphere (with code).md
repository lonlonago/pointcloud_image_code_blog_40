   The spherical equation can be expressed as: in the formula, the coordinates of the target point; the spherical center coordinates; the radius of the sphere. As shown in Figure 1, the radius and spherical center coordinates are regarded as unknown parameters, and the square sum of the distance from the point to the fitted spherical surface is the minimum criterion. After linearizing the spherical equation, the spherical center coordinates are solved according to the least squares principle.
